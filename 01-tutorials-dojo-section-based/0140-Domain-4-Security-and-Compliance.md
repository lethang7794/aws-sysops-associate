## 4.1 S3 Bucket Delete

You can only delete buckets that don't have any objects in them [^4.1.1].

> [!Note]
> In a versioning bucket, objects can have delete markers & multiple variants.

For a versioning bucket, to _permanently_ delete an object, all versions of that object needs to be deleted first. This can be done with:

- Manually via Web Console
- SDK
- Life-cycle methods [^4.1.2]

  - `Expiration`: Expire current object versions

    Retains the current version as noncurrent version then add a `delete marker`, which becomes the current version)

  - `NoncurrentVersionExpiration`: Permanently remove noncurrent object versions

> [!NOTE]
> MFA delete [^4.1.3] requires additional authentication for either of the following operations:
>
> - Changing the versioning state of your bucket
> - Permanently deleting an object version

If a bucket's versioning configuration is MFA delete enabled, the bucket owner must include the `x-amz-mfa` [^4.1.4] request header in requests to

- change the versioning state of the bucket.
- permanently delete an object version or

## 4.17 [Security Best Practices in IAM]

- Follow best practices to protect your **root user** credentials
- Require multi-factor authentication (**MFA**)
- Require human users üë™ to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS using _temporary credentials_
- Require workloads üíª to use _temporary credentials_ with IAM roles to access AWS
- For use cases ü™® that require _long-term credentials_ , update (& remove) access keys when needed
- Apply **least-privilege** ü§è permissions
  - Get started with _AWS managed policies_ and move toward least-privilege permissions
  - Use _conditions_ in IAM policies to further restrict access
- Regularly review and remove unused users, roles, permissions, policies, and credentials
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to
  - Generate least-privilege policies based on access activity
  - Verify public and cross-account access to resources
  - Validate your IAM policies to ensure secure and functional permissions
- Limit permission for
  - An account üõü üëà Permissions boundaries
  - Multiple accounts ü¶∫üõ•Ô∏è üëà AWS Organization + Service Control Policies (SCP)

## 4.21 [RDS Encryption]

Encrypting a RDS instance is a one-way decision that needs to be make when creating the instance.

- You can't (directly) **turn on** encryption on an un-encrypted RDS instance.

> [!TIP]
> What if you've already have un-encrypted RDS instance?
>
> 1. Create a snapshot of the un-encrypted RDS instance.
> 2. Create an encrypted copy of that un-encrypted snapshot.
> 3. Restore a DB instance from that encrypted snapshot.

- You can't (directly)
  - **turn off** encryption on an encrypted RDS instance.
  - **un-encrypt** an encrypted RDS instance.

> [!TIP]
> What if you really need to remove the encryption from a RDS instance?
>
> 1. Export data from an encrypted DB instance.
> 2. Import the data into an unencrypted DB instance.

Snapshots, read replicas (of an encrypted RDS instance) use the same encryption key as the source.

> [!TIP]
> If it's in a different region, you need to specify the KMS key in the destination region.
