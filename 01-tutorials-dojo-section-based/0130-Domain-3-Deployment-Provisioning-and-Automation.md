## 3.1 VPC IPv6 migration

Step 1: Associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC & subnets
Step 2: Update your route tables (to route your IPv6 traffic)
Step 3: Update your security group rules (to include rules for IPv6 addresses)
Step 4: Assign IPv6 addresses to your instances (from the IPv6 address range of your subnet)
