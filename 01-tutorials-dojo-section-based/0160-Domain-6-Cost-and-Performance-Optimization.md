## 6.6 Allocation strategies for Spot Instances

- Allocation strategies:
  - `lowestPrice` (default) üõëüõëüõëüí∞
    - Used with `InstancePoolsToUseCount`
  - `priceCapacityOptimized` (recommended) üõëüõëüí∞üí∞
  - `capacityOptimized` üõëüí∞üí∞üí∞
  - `diversified`: Request evenly across all available pools

## 6.11 Is there any other AWS services support online vertical scaling?

TODO: Research services supports online vertical scaling

## 6.29 Best practice for tagging AWS resources

### Enforcing tagging [^6.29.2]

- Manually managed resources

  - AWS Resource Group : Tag Editor console / Tagging API allows
  - EC2 launch template : Tags
  - AWS Config Rules: check for required_tags & start a Lambda function to apply them

- Infrastructure as code (IaC) managed resources

  - CloudFormation : Template : Resource Tags
    - AWS CloudFormation Hooks
  - AWS Service Catalog

- CI/CD pipeline managed resources
  - CloudFormation
    - AWS CloudFormation Guard
