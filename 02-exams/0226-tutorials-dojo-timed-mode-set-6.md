## 2.1 EKS Scaling

EKS supports two **autoscaling** products (cluster-level)

- K8s `Cluster Autoscaler`: adjusts the number of nodes in your cluster (use Auto Scaling Group).
- `Karpenter`: provision just-in-time compute resources that precisely meet the requirements of your workload.

Your workloads are deployed in containers, which are deployed in Pods in Kubernetes.

Once you've deployed multiple Pods that provide the same service, you can

- Vertically scale Pods up or down with the K8s `Vertical Pod Autoscaler`.
- Horizontally scale the number of Pods needed to meet demand up or down with the K8s `Horizontal Pod Autoscaler`.

## 3.2 Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation StackSets

Common reasons for stack operation failure[^3.2.1]

- Target Account - Administrator Account - Permission
- Cfn Template
- Limit

## 3.5 AWS Systems Manager Distributor

### What is Distributor

`Distributor`[^3.5.1] helps you package and publish software to AWS Systems Manager managed nodes.

### How Distributor works?

When you create a package in Distributor, the system creates an AWS Systems Manager document (SSM document). You can attach .zip files to this document.

When you run Distributor, the system processes the instructions in the SSM document and installs the software package in the .zip file on the specified targets.

You can use

- SSM **`Run Command`** üëâ once-time
- SSM **`State Manager`** üëâ on a automated schedule

to control which of your managed nodes get a package and which version of that package.

## 4.5 Cross account resource access in IAM

With IAM, you can share access to AWS resources in a account to another accounts.[^4.5.1]

You can do this:

- Directly by using IAM resource-based policy[^4.5.2] (only supports S3, SNS, SQS)

  > [!NOTE]
  > When an account accesses a resource through another account using a resource-based policy:
  >
  > - The `principal`[^4.5.3] still works in the `trusted account` and does not have to give up their permissions to receive the role permissions
  > - In other words, the principal continues to have access to resources in the trusted account while having access to the resource in the `trusting account`

- In-directly via an IAM role[^4.5.4] as a proxy

  - Create a role in one AWS account that delegates specific permissions to another AWS account.

  - Use `cross-account IAM roles` that allows IAM principals in another AWS account to assume the role. [^4.5.5][^4.5.6]

  > [!NOTE]
  > A `cross-account IAM role` is an IAM role that includes a `trust policy`[^4.5.7] that allows IAM principals in another AWS account to assume the role.

  > [!NOTE]
  > When a principal switches to a role to temporarily use the permissions of the role, they give up their original permissions and take on the permissions assigned to the role they‚Äôve assumed.
